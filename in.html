<h3 class="diff">Introduction</h3>
<p class="marg">
Independent mobility and navigation is a well-highlighted problem by blind and visually impaired (BVI) population. Visiting new places independently is a more chaotic and
challenging experience due to poor access to navigational information, less on-ground visual and non-visual information cues and indoor structural complexity. There has
been tremendous improvement in accessible outdoor navigation support due to ready availability of GPS devices (mobile phones) combined with solutions like Google Map,
Open Street Maps (OSM), Foursquare, etc. It is enabling even for first-time visitors to navigate easily while either walking or driving. Before the advent of these technologies,
because of weak signage and non-standard street numbering, even for sighted users, unassisted navigation has been a major challenge in urban centers in India and other
similar developing countries.
</p>  
<h3 class="diff">Reseach Objective</h3>
<p class="marg">
Globally indoor spaces are still by and large inaccessible to visually impaired without sighted assistance. The situation is even poorer in low-resource countries where regulations
are weak, design including signage are either non-existent or even if present nonstandard. Apart from navigation issues, the protruding objects in the corridors which
are not uncommon create safety concerns as well. The prime objective of the proposed research is to look at the problem of indoor navigation of blind and visually impaired
(BVI) in a holistic manner taking into consideration the built infrastructure prevailing in India and other low-resource countries. The work would involve both design and innovation
in accessible digital mapping, semantic localization and design interaction along with prototyping and user validation focusing on indoor spaces. Even globally the Field
is in a very nascent stage and considerable work is required to develop a versatile indoor navigation system and to define performance metrics to assess effectiveness of solutions.

<h3 class="diff">Motivation</h3>
<p class="marg">
Many fast-growing economies like India and China have a large young population but the certain demographic shift would mean a very significant fraction of the population would be above the age of 50 years in the coming
decades. These population segments are going to be more dependent, less confident and more isolated due to inaccessibility while living long years due to better health facilities and thus leading a very poor quality of life.

Independent mobility is one of those activities and it is a primary requirement for social inclusion and economic sustainability of the blind and visually impaired (BVI)
people. If we confine this problem to daily life scenarios, indoor wayfinding at new places is challenging for BVI people. The most common causes are information unavailability/ inaccessibility, poor representation and placement, lack of orientation and mobility
training, structural complexity arising out of incremental structural changes.
